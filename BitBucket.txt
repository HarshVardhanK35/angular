BitBucket

- we use this for continuous integration
---
	steps involved in this process are:
	creating an angular project 
	configuring build command in bitbucket pipelines
	generate an artifacts folder for deployment 

to create an angular project
	- download node and npm
	- install angular CLI [use: npm i -g @angular/cli] => to run angular code
	- cd my-app and ng serve

2. create a repo in bitbucket
	- push the angular code into a branch

3. create pipelines 
	- select a template [node / PHP/ maven etc.,]

if node selected, then add the following into it's template

image: node <version>

pipelines: 
	default: 
		- step: 
			name: Installing dependencies
			caches: 
				- node
			script: 
				- npm install

		- step: 
			name: Lint check
			caches: 
				- node
			script: 
				- npm run lint

		- step: 
			name: Build
			caches: 
				- node
			script: 
				- npm run build
			artifacts: 
				- dist/**

RESULT: 
- this then will generate a dist-folder.. which has to be uploaded to "firebase", right?
